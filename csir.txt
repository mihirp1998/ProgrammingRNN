Let's start with talking about the current top-notch video security systems available in the market.For example, Intel surviellance sytem like many others, provides us with IOT based vision system which is able to do video analytics at the edge. These smart video systems use computer vision tools for video analytics and send the critical information to the user and thus enable situational awareness.

But this critical information which was sent does not align with the user's requirement, As the communication between the user and the video is just ONE Way. For example - If the shopkeeper wants to know "How many customers, came in the last 10 minutes" or "At what time did someone wearing a helmet come in the shop". There is no way in which these questions can be communicated to the current system. 

With the current advancement in the field of Visual Question Answering, we present an AI-Complete platform which will integrate NLP and Vision and thus will be able to answer an open ended question for a specific video.After this the user doesn't need to go through the Entire Video to get his specific question answered. Our platform will understand the video along with the question and thus allow the user to have a natural language interaction with it.
